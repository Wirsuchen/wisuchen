## üß™ Automated Testing

### Run Test Script

I've created an API test script for you. Run it with:

```bash
node test-api.js
```

This will test all your API endpoints automatically.

---

## üîç Database Testing

### Check Supabase Data

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Table Editor

#### Tables to Verify:
- **profiles** - User data after registration
- **offers** - Jobs and affiliate offers
- **categories** - Categories data
- **payments** - Payment records
- **invoices** - Generated invoices
- **import_runs** - Import logs
- **impressions** - Analytics tracking

### Run SQL Queries

In Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check total users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;

-- Check active jobs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM offers WHERE status = 'active' AND offer_type = 'job';

-- Check recent imports
SELECT * FROM import_runs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check payments
SELECT * FROM payments ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check categories
SELECT * FROM categories ORDER BY offers_count DESC;
```
